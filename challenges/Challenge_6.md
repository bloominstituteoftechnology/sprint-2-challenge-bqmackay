     // ðŸ§  diceRolls takes no arguments and returns a number
      // The function throws a six-sided dice until 3 sixes in a row are obtained
      // The number of throws it took to obtain that third-in-a-row six is then returned from the function
      // ðŸŒŸ HINT: research using `Math.random` to obtain a number from 1 to 6
      // ðŸŒŸ HINT: use `while(true)` to throw the dice indefinitely, but avoid an infinite loop by making sure to break out eventually
      // ðŸŒŸ HINT: you need to keep track of the total number of throws, as well as how many sixes in a row
